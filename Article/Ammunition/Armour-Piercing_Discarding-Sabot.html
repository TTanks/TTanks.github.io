    <p>An important armour-piercing development was the armour-piercing discarding sabot (APDS). 
      An early version was developed by engineers working for the French Edgar Brandt company, and 
      was fielded in two calibres (75 mm/57 mm for the 75 mm Mle1897/33 anti-tank gun, 37 mm/25 mm 
      for several 37 mm gun types) just before the French-German armistice of 1940. The Edgar Brandt 
      engineers, having been evacuated to the United Kingdom, joined ongoing APDS development efforts there, 
      culminating in significant improvements to the concept and its realization. The APDS projectile type was 
      further developed in the United Kingdom between 1941 and 1944 by L. Permutter and S. W. Coppock, two 
      designers with the Armaments Research Department. In mid-1944 the APDS projectile was first introduced 
      into service for the UK's QF 6-pdr anti-tank gun and later in September 1944 for the QF-17 pdr anti-tank 
      gun. The idea was to use a stronger and denser penetrator material with smaller size and hence less drag, 
      to allow increased impact velocity and armour penetration. <br><br>

      The armour-piercing concept calls for more penetration capability than the target's armour thickness. The 
      penetrator is a pointed mass of high-density material that is designed to retain its shape and carry the maximum 
      possible amount of energy as deeply as possible into the target. Generally, the penetration capability of an 
      armour-piercing round increases with the projectile's kinetic energy and also with concentration of that energy 
      in a small area. Thus, an efficient means of achieving increased penetrating power is increased velocity for the 
      projectile. However, projectile impact against armour at higher velocity causes greater levels of shock. Materials 
      have characteristic maximum levels of shock capacity, beyond which they may shatter, or otherwise disintegrate. At 
      relatively high impact velocities, steel is no longer an adequate material for armour-piercing rounds. Tungsten and 
      tungsten alloys are suitable for use in even higher-velocity armour-piercing rounds, due to their very high shock 
      tolerance and shatter resistance, and to their high melting and boiling temperatures. They also have very high density. 
      Aircraft and tank rounds sometimes use a core of depleted uranium. Depleted-uranium penetrators have the advantage of being 
      pyrophoric and self-sharpening on impact, resulting in intense heat and energy focused on a minimal area of the target's 
      armour. Some rounds also use explosive or incendiary tips to aid in the penetration of thicker armour. High explosive 
      incendiary/armour piercing ammunition combines a tungsten carbide penetrator with an incendiary and explosive tip. <br><br>

      Energy is concentrated by using a reduced-diameter tungsten shot, surrounded by a lightweight outer carrier, the sabot 
      (a French word for a wooden shoe). This combination allows the firing of a smaller diameter (thus lower mass/aerodynamic 
      resistance/penetration resistance) projectile with a larger area of expanding-propellant "push", thus a greater propelling 
      force and resulting kinetic energy. Once outside the barrel, the sabot is stripped off by a combination of centrifugal force 
      and aerodynamic force, giving the shot low drag in flight. For a given calibre, the use of APDS ammunition can effectively 
      double the anti-tank performance of a gun.
