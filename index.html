    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>A tank is an armoured fighting vehicle intended as a primary offensive weapon in front-line ground combat. <br> 
      Tank designs are a balance of heavy firepower, strong armour, and good battlefield mobility provided by tracks and a powerful engine; usually their main armament <br> 
      is mounted in a turret. They are a mainstay of modern 20th and 21st century ground forces and a key part of combined arms combat.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The first concept of a tank is from Leonardo Da Vinci. And the first tank to be used in <br> 
      warfare is the British Mark I, it's first used in September of 1916 to fight in the trenches of WW1. <br><br> 

      Before long, one british tank got captured by the <br> 
      Germans and renamed to the Beutepanzerwagen IV. Using the captured tank as a reference, the <br> 
      Germans created the PzKpfw Panther and Tiger, which is largely superior to the Alliance's <br><br>

      Due to the Axis's apparent superiority over the Alliance, they were forced to keep up. <br> 
      Creating tanks such as the Curchill tank, Cromwell tank, M4 Sherman, etc. <br><br></p>
