        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>A tank is an armored fighting vehicle intended as a primary offensive weapon in front-line ground combat.
        Tank designs are a balance of heavy firepower, strong armor, and good battlefield mobility provided by tracks
        and a powerful engine; usually their main armament is mounted in a turret. They are a mainstay of modern 20th
        and 21st-century ground forces and a key part of combined arms combat.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The first concept of a tank is from Leonardo Da Vinci. And the first tank to be used in warfare is the
        British Mark I; it was first used in September of 1916 to fight in the trenches of WW1. Before long, one
        British tank got captured by the Germans and renamed to the Beutepanzerwagen IV. Using the captured tank as a
        reference, the Germans created the PzKpfw Panther and Tiger, which are largely superior to the Alliance's.
        Due to the Axis's apparent superiority over the Alliance, they were forced to keep up, creating tanks such as
          the Churchill tank, Cromwell tank, M4 Sherman, etc.</p>
